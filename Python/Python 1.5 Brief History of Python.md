Python is a high level interpreted general purpose programming language. Python is a dynamically typed programming language.It supports many programming types: Structured, Object-oriented and Functional. Python is well known for the enormous library it has.

## Inventor of Python?

<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a> started to work on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. The first version of Python was released on 1991, version:0.9.0
The latest version of Python(3.9.7) can be downloaded by clicking <a href = "https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.7/python-3.9.7-amd64.exe">here</a>

## History

1. The implementation of Python started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.
2. The first version of Python was published to alt.sources.
3. In 1994, Python 1.0 had libraries like lambda, map, reduce, filter.
4. Python 2.0 released with comprehensions and garbage collection systems.
5. Python 3.0 was released on December 3, 2008.
6. Python is influenced by 2 programming languages: ABC Programming Langugae and Modula-3
7. ABC programming language is said to be the predecessor of Python language, which was capable of Exception Handling and interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System.
8. Modula-3's main features are simplicity and safety while preserving the power of a systems-programming language.

## Name Python

Guido van Rossum was reading the script of a popular BBC comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus". It was late on-air 1970s.Van Rossum wanted to select a name which unique, sort, and little-bit mysterious. So he decided to select naming Python after the "Monty Python's Flying Circus" for their newly created programming language.The comedy series was creative and well random. It talks about everything. Thus it is slow and unpredictable, which made it very interesting.

Python is a programming language which used in many spheres of life nowadays:

1. Machine Learning
2. Automation
3. Web Applications
4. Embedded systems
5. Data Analysis
6. Game Development
